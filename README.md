# CobraOS
CobraOS is a FOSS mobile operating system that strives to provide an enhanced security profile while not sacrificing on usability. CobraOS was founded on strict KISS principals with the community in mind, allowing talented minds to collaborate on creating a unique Android ROM that challenges and surpasses other security minded Android ROMS. The diffientiating factor of the project is that instead of being based solely on Android and the Linux kernal, CobraOS is designed from the ground up to use the CobraKernal, which prioritizes low level security through the use of Rust as the primary  low level language, ensuring that the device is secure even from the most sophisticated kernal exploits common on Android devices. If you are interested in contributing to the project please email me at jlsoffical@gmail.com, collaboration on the project would be much appreciated as I continue to refine my programming skills.
